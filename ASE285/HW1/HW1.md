# ASE 285 Homework 1 

* 50 points in total
* Use the `Last-First-HW#' directory as a template directory. Copy all your results in the results directory (create sub-directories if necessary) and complete (mark and grade) the grading.docx in the directory. 
* Change the directory name; for example, `Cho-Samuel-HW#` is the directory name if I submit the homework (# should be replaced with the HW number). Notice that last name comes first. 
* Zip the directory to make a zip file, for example, `Cho-Samuel-HW#.zip` (# should be replaced with the HW number), to submit them on Canvas.
